# AWS CloudFormation quotas<a name="cloudformation-limits"></a>

Your AWS account has AWS CloudFormation quotas that you might need to know when authoring templates and creating stacks\. By understanding these quotas, you can avoid limitation errors that would require you to redesign your templates or stacks\.


**AWS CloudFormation quotas**  

|  Quotas  |  Description  |  Value  |  Tuning strategy  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  [cfn\-signal wait condition data](cfn-signal.md)  |  Maximum amount of data that cfn\-signal can pass\.  |  4,096 bytes  |  To pass a larger amount, send the data to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then use cfn\-signal to pass the Amazon S3 URL to that bucket\.  |

|  [Parameters](template-anatomy.md)  |  Maximum number of parameters that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template\.  |  200 parameters  |  To specify more parameters, you can use mappings or lists in order to assign multiple values to a single parameter\.  |

|  [Parameter value](template-anatomy.md)  |  Maximum size of a parameter value\.  |  4,096 bytes  |  To use a larger parameter value, create multiple parameters and then use `Fn::Join` to append the multiple values into a single value\.  | 
|  [Private resources](registry.md)  |  Maximum number of private resources that you can register in the CloudFormation registry per account and Region\.  |  50 private resources  |    | 
|  [Private resource versions](registry.md)  |  Maximum number of versions that you can register in the CloudFormation registry for a given private resource\.  |  50 private resources  |  To register new versions, first use [DeregisterType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterType.html) to deregister versions you aren't using anymore\.  | 
|  [Resources](template-anatomy.md)  |  Maximum number of resources that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template\.  |  500 resources  |  To specify more resources, separate your template into multiple templates by using, for example, [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html)\.  | 
|  [Resources in concurrent stack operations](template-anatomy.md)   |  Maximum number of resources you can have involved in stack operations \(create, update, or delete operations\) in your Region at a given time\.  | Use the [DescribeAccountLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountLimits.html) API to determine the current limit for an account in a specific Region\. |  | 
|  [Resource name](template-anatomy.md)  |  Maximum size of a resource name\.  |  255 characters  |  | 
|  [Stacks](stacks.md)  |  Maximum number of CloudFormation stacks that you can create\.  |  2000 stacks  |  To create more stacks, delete stacks that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stacks in your AWS account\. For more information, see [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.  | 
|  [Stack name](cfn-using-console-create-stack-parameters.md)  |  Maximum size of Stack name\.  |  128 characters  |    | 
|  [StackSets](what-is-cfnstacksets.md)  |  Maximum number of AWS CloudFormation stack sets you can create in your administrator account\.  |  100 stack sets  |  To create more stack sets, delete stack sets that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stack sets in your AWS account\. For more information, see [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.  | 
|  [Stack instances](what-is-cfnstacksets.md)  |  Maximum number of stack instances you can create per stack set\.  |  2000 stack instances per stack set  |  To create more stack instances, delete stack instances that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stack instances in your AWS account\.

## StackSets and macros<a name="stacksets-macros"></a>
