# Register a delegated administrator<a name="stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin"></a>

In addition to your organization's management account, member accounts with delegated administrator permissions can create and manage stack sets with service\-managed permissions for the organization\. Stack sets with service\-managed permissions are created in the management account, including stack sets created by delegated administrators\. To be registered as a delegated administrator for your organization, your member account must be in the organization\. For more information about joining an organization, see [Inviting an AWS account to join your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html)\.

Your organization can have up to five registered delegated administrators at one time\. Delegated administrators can choose to deploy to all accounts in your organization or specific OUs\. Trusted access with AWS Organizations must be activated before delegated administrators can deploy to accounts managed by Organizations\. For more information, see [Activate trusted access with AWS Organizations](stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.md)\.

**Important**  
Delegated administrators have full permissions to deploy to accounts in your organization\. The management account can't limit delegated administrator permissions to deploy to specific OUs or to perform specific stack set operations\.
