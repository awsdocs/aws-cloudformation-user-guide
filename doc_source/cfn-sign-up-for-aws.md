Before you can use AWS CloudFormation or any Amazon Web Services, you must first sign up for an AWS account\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
This might be unavailable in your browser if you previously signed into the AWS Management Console\. In that case, choose **Sign in to a different account**, and then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad\.

After signing up for an AWS account, you can use AWS CloudFormation through the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [AWS CloudFormation API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/), or [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation)\.
