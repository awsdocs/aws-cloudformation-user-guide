# Viewing deleted stacks on the AWS CloudFormation console<a name="cfn-console-view-deleted-stacks"></a>

By default, the AWS CloudFormation console does not display stacks with a status of **DELETE\_COMPLETE**\. To display information about deleted stacks, you must change the stack view\.

**To view deleted stacks**
+ On the **Stacks** page of the CloudFormation console, select **Deleted** from the filter list\.  
![\[The Deleted option in the Filter menu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-stacks-filter-deleted.png)

  AWS CloudFormation lists all of your deleted stacks \(stacks with a status of **DELETE\_COMPLETE**\)\.
