# Viewing deleted stacks on the AWS CloudFormation console<a name="cfn-console-view-deleted-stacks"></a>

By default, the AWS CloudFormation console doesn't display stacks with a status of **DELETE\_COMPLETE**\. To display information about deleted stacks, you must change the stack view\.

**To view deleted stacks**
+ On the **Stacks** page of the CloudFormation console, select **Deleted** from the filter list\.  
![\[The Deleted option in the Filter menu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-stack-filter-deleted.png)

  CloudFormation lists all your deleted stacks \(stacks with a status of **DELETE\_COMPLETE**\)\.
