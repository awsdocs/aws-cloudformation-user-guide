# Viewing Deleted Stacks on the AWS CloudFormation Console<a name="cfn-console-view-deleted-stacks"></a>

By default, the AWS CloudFormation console does not display stacks in the **DELETE\_COMPLETE** state\. To display information about deleted stacks, you must change the stack view\.

**To view deleted stacks**
+ In the AWS CloudFormation console, select **Deleted** from the **Filter** list\.  
![\[The Deleted option in the Filter menu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/cfn-console-view-deleted-stack-setting.png)

  AWS CloudFormation lists all of your deleted stacks \(stacks with **DELETE\_COMPLETE** status\)\.
