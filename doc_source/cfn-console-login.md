# Logging in to the AWS Management Console<a name="cfn-console-login"></a>

The AWS CloudFormation console allows you to create, monitor, update, and delete your AWS CloudFormation stacks with a web\-based interface\. It's part of the AWS Management Console\.

You can access the AWS CloudFormation console in a number of ways:
+ Open the AWS CloudFormation console directly with the URL [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudformation/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\. If you aren't logged in to the AWS Management Console yet, you need to log in before using the AWS CloudFormation console\.
+ If you are logged into and using the AWS Management Console, you can access the AWS CloudFormation console from the home page by:
  + Selecting **CloudFormation** from under **Management and Governance**\.
  + Searching for CloudFormation using the search bar\.
  + Selecting **CloudFormation** from **Recently visited services**, if you've used CloudFormation recently\.

If you don't have any AWS CloudFormation stacks running, you are presented with the option to **Create a stack**\. Otherwise, you see a list of your currently running stacks\.
