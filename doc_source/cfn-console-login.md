# Logging In to the AWS CloudFormation Console<a name="cfn-console-login"></a>

 The AWS CloudFormation console allows you to create, monitor, update, and delete your AWS CloudFormation stacks with a web\-based interface\. It is part of the AWS Management Console\. 

 You can access the AWS CloudFormation console in a number of ways: 
+ Open the AWS CloudFormation console directly with the URL [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudformation/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\. If you are not logged in to the AWS Management Console yet, you need to log in before using the AWS CloudFormation console\.
+ If you are logged into and using the AWS Management Console, you can access the AWS CloudFormation console by opening the **Services** menu and selecting **CloudFormation** in one of the following sub\-menus:
  + **Deployment and Management**  
![\[The CloudFormation option in the Deployment and Management submenu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-service-selector-deployment.png)
  + **All Services**  
![\[The CloudFormation option in the All AWS Services menu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-service-selector-all.png)

If you don't have any AWS CloudFormation stacks running, you are presented with the option to **Create a stack**\. Otherwise, you see a list of your currently\-running stacks\.
