# CloudFormation resource provider schemas<a name="resource-type-schemas"></a>

In addition to the [resource specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html), CloudFormation makes available the resource provider schemas for the Amazon resources by region\. Each resource provider schema is a JSON\-formatted text file that defines the properties and attributes of a specific resource\. 

For each region, CloudFormation offers a zip file containing the individual schema files for each resource available in that region\. To download the resource provider schemas for a specific region, see the following table\. You can also view a resource's provider schema using the [CloudFormation registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html)\.

Resource availability may vary by region\. To check the availability of a resource in a given region, refer to the resource provider schemas for that region\.

To learn more about resource provider schemas, including schema format and definitions, see [Resource provider schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html) in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
