`Type`  <a name="cfn-ecs-service-deploymentcontroller-type"></a>
The deployment controller type to use\. There are three deployment controller types available:    
ECS  
The rolling update \(`ECS`\) deployment type involves replacing the current running version of the container with the latest version\. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting the minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks allowed during a service deployment, as specified in the [DeploymentConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentConfiguration.html)\.  
CODE\_DEPLOY  
The blue/green \(`CODE_DEPLOY`\) deployment type uses the blue/green deployment model powered by AWS CodeDeploy, which allows you to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it\.  
EXTERNAL  
The external \(`EXTERNAL`\) deployment type enables you to use any third\-party deployment controller for full control over the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service\.
