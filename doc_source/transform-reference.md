# Transform reference<a name="transform-reference"></a>

This section contains reference information for the transforms AWS CloudFormation supports\. Transforms are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation\. Unlike custom macros, a transform doesn't require any special permissions to use it because it is hosted by AWS CloudFormation\. Transforms can be used in templates in any account within AWS CloudFormation\. Also, there is no charge incurred when using transforms\. AWS CloudFormation treats a transform the same as any other macro in terms of evaluation order and scope\. 

For information about using transforms in your templates, see [Transform template section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-section-structure.html)\. For information about macros, see [Using macros to perform custom processing on templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html)\.
