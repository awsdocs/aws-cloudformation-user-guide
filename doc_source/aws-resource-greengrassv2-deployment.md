# AWS::GreengrassV2::Deployment<a name="aws-resource-greengrassv2-deployment"></a>

Creates a continuous deployment for a target, which is a AWS IoT Greengrass core device or group of core devices\. When you add a new core device to a group of core devices that has a deployment, AWS IoT Greengrass deploys that group's deployment to the new device\.

You can define one deployment for each target\. When you create a new deployment for a target that has an existing deployment, you replace the previous deployment\. AWS IoT Greengrass applies the new deployment to the target devices\. 

You can only add, update, or delete up to 10 deployments at a time to a single target\.

Every deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deployment revisions you define for a target\. Use this operation to create a new revision of an existing deployment\. This operation returns the revision number of the new deployment when you create it\.

For more information, see the [Create deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/create-deployments.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide*\.

**Important**  
Deployment resources are deleted when you delete stacks\. To keep the deployments in a stack, you must specify `"DeletionPolicy": "Retain"` on each deployment resource in the stack template that you want to keep\. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html)\.  
You can only delete up to 10 deployment resources at a time\. If you delete more than 10 resources, you receive an error\.
