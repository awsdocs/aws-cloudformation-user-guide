# AWS::GameLift::Fleet ResourceCreationLimitPolicy<a name="aws-properties-gamelift-fleet-resourcecreationlimitpolicy"></a>

A policy that limits the number of game sessions a player can create on the same fleet\. This optional policy gives game owners control over how players can consume available game server resources\. A resource creation policy makes the following statement: "An individual player can create a maximum number of new game sessions within a specified time period"\.

The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session\. For example, assume you have a policy of 10 new game sessions and a time period of 60 minutes\. On receiving a `CreateGameSession` request, Amazon GameLift checks that the player \(identified by `CreatorId`\) has created fewer than 10 game sessions in the past 60 minutes\.

`NewGameSessionsPerCreator`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-resourcecreationlimitpolicy-newgamesessionspercreator"></a>
A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time\. With this policy, you can control players' ability to consume available resources\.  
The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session\. On receiving a `CreateGameSession` request, Amazon GameLift checks that the player \(identified by `CreatorId`\) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period\.
