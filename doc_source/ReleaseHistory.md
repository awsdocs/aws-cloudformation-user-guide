|  Conditionally create resources and assign properties  |  November 8, 2013  |  Using input parameters, you can control the creation and settings of designated stack resources by defining conditions in your AWS CloudFormation templates\. For example, you can use conditions to create stack resources for a production environment\. Using the same template, you can create similar stack resources with lower capacity for a test environment\. For more information, see [Condition Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-conditions.html)\.  |  2010\-05\-15  |

|  Assign custom resource types  |  November 8, 2013  |  In your templates, you can specify your own resource type for AWS CloudFormation custom resources \(`AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource`\)\. By using your own custom resource type name, you can quickly identify the type of custom resources that you have in your stack\. For example, you can specify `"Type": "Custom::MyCustomResource"`\. For more information, see [AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cfn-customresource.html)\.  |  2010\-05\-15  |

For more information, see [AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-elasticache-cache-cluster.html)\.  |  2010\-05\-15  | 
|  Parallel stack creation, update and deletion, and nested stack updates   |  August 12, 2013  |  AWS CloudFormation now creates, updates, and deletes resources in parallel, improving the operations' performance\.

|  Rolling deployments for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups  |  February 20, 2013  |  AWS CloudFormation now supports update policies on Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, which describe how instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group are replaced or modified when the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group adds or removes instances\. You can modify these settings at stack creation or during a stack update\. For more information and an example, see [UpdatePolicy Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html)\.  |  2010\-05\-15  | 
|  Cancel and rollback action for stack updates  |  February 20, 2013  |  AWS CloudFormation supports the ability to cancel a stack update\.
