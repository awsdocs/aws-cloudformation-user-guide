# Sample templates<a name="cfn-sample-templates"></a>

AWS CloudFormation sample templates demonstrate how you can create templates for various uses\. For example, one sample template describes a load\-balancing, auto scaling WordPress blog in an Amazon VPC\. We recommend that you use these sample templates as a starting point for creating your own templates and not to launch production\-level environments\.

**Note**  
 The AWS Quick Starts use AWS CloudFormation templates to automate software deployments, such as a Chef Server or MongoDB, on AWS\. You can use these templates to learn how to deploy your own solution on AWS\. For more information, see [AWS quick start reference deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/)\.
