# Creating a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console<a name="cfn-console-create-stack"></a>

Before you create a stack, you must have a template that describes what resources AWS CloudFormation will include in your stack\. For more information, see [Working with AWS CloudFormation templates](template-guide.md)\.

**Note**  
To preview the configuration of a new stack, you can [use a change set](cfn-console-create-stacks-changesets.md)\.

Creating a stack on the CloudFormation console is an easy, wizard\-driven process that consists of the following steps:

1. [Starting the Create Stack wizard](#cfn-using-console-initiating-stack-creation)

1. [Selecting a stack template](cfn-using-console-create-stack-template.md)

1. [Specifying stack parameters](cfn-using-console-create-stack-parameters.md)

1. [Setting AWS CloudFormation stack options](cfn-console-add-tags.md)

1. [Reviewing your stack](cfn-using-console-create-stack-review.md)

After creating a stack, you can monitor the stack's progress, view the stack's resources and outputs, update the stack, and delete it\. Information about these actions are provided in their associated topics\.
