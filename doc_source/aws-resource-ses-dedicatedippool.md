# AWS::SES::DedicatedIpPool<a name="aws-resource-ses-dedicatedippool"></a>

Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses\. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your AWS account\. You can associate a pool with a configuration set\. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, the message is sent from one of the addresses in the associated pool\.

**Important**  
You can't delete dedicated IP pools that have a `STANDARD` scaling mode with one or more dedicated IP addresses\. This constraint doesn't apply to dedicated IP pools that have a `MANAGED` scaling mode\.
