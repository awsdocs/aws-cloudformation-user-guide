# Viewing a change set<a name="using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-view"></a>

After you create a change set, you can view the proposed changes before executing them\. You can use the CloudFormation console, AWS CLI, or CloudFormation API to view change sets\. The CloudFormation console provides a summary of the changes and a detailed list of changes in JSON format\. The AWS CLI and AWS CloudFormation API return a detailed list of changes in JSON format\.

------
#### [ View a change set for nested stack \(console\) ]

**To view a change set for nested stacks \(console\)**

1. In the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), in **Stacks**, choose the name of the stack that contains the change set that you want to view\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change Sets** to view a list of the stack's change sets\.

1. Choose the name of the change set that you want to view\.

   The CloudFormation console directs you to the change set's details page, where you can see the time the change set was created, its status, the input used to generate the change set, and a summary of the changes\.  
![\[The details page for the change set.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-nested-stacks-change-sets-details.png)

   In the **Changes** section, each row represents a resource that CloudFormation will add, modify, remove, or show the status of dynamic\.
   + **Add** – CloudFormation creates a resource when you add a resource to the stack's template\.
   + **Modify** – CloudFormation modifies a resource when you change the properties of a resource in the stack's template\.
   + **Remove** – CloudFormation deletes a resource when you delete a resource from the stack's template\.
   + **Dynamic** – CloudFormation can't determine the exact resource change action from the nested stack's template\.
**Note**  
A modification can cause the resource to be interrupted or replaced \(recreated\)\. For more information about resource update behaviors, see [Update behaviors of stack resources](using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md)\.

   To focus on specific changes, use the filter view\. For example, filter for a specific resource type, such as **AWS::CloudFormation::Stack**\. To filter for a specific resource, specify its logical or physical ID, such as **DeadLetterQueue** or **NestedStack**\.

1. In the **Changes** section, choose **View nested change set** of the nested change set you want to view\.

   The CloudFormation console directs you to the nested change set's details page\. You can choose **Go to root change set** to view the root change set or, you can choose **View parent change set** to view the parent change set\. For more information see, [Change sets for nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/change-sets-for-nested-stacks.html)\.

**To view a change set \(AWS CLI\)**

1. To get the ID of the change set, run the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-change-sets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-change-sets.html) command\.

   Specify the stack ID of the stack that has the change set that you want to view, as shown in the following example:

   ```
   aws cloudformation list-change-sets --stack-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/SampleStack/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000
   ```

   CloudFormation returns a list of change sets, similar to the following:

   ```
   {
       "Summaries": [
           {
               "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/SampleStack/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000",

           },
           {

           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Run the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-change-set.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-change-set.html) command, specifying the ID of the change set that you want to view\. For example:

   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-change-set --change-set-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000
   ```

   CloudFormation returns information about the specified change set:

   }
   ```

   The `Changes` key lists changes to resources\. If you were to execute this change set, CloudFormation would update the tags of the `i-1abc23d4` EC2 instance\. For a description of each field, see the [Change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Change.html) data type in the *AWS CloudFormation API Reference*\.
