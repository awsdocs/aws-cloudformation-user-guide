# Infrastructure security in AWS CloudFormation<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS CloudFormation is protected by the AWS global network security\. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/)\. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework*\.

You use AWS published API calls to access AWS CloudFormation through the network\. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)\. We require TLS 1\.2 and recommend TLS 1\.3\.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as DHE \(Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\) or ECDHE \(Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but AWS CloudFormation does support resource\-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address\. You can also use AWS CloudFormation policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) endpoints or specific VPCs\. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given AWS CloudFormation resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network\.
