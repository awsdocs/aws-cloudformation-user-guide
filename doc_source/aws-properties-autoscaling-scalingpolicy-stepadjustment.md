# AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy StepAdjustment<a name="aws-properties-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-stepadjustment"></a>

 `StepAdjustment` specifies a step adjustment for the `StepAdjustments` property of the [AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-policy.html) resource\.

For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50: 
+ To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10\. 
+ To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of \-10 and an upper bound of 0\. 

There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy: 
+ The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap\. 
+ At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound\. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound\. 
+ At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound\. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound\. 
+ The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment\.

For more information, see [Step adjustments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-steps) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*\.

## Properties<a name="aws-properties-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-stepadjustment-properties"></a>

`MetricIntervalLowerBound`  <a name="cfn-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-stepadjustment-metricintervallowerbound"></a>
The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric\. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive \(the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound\)\. Otherwise, it is exclusive \(the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound\)\. A null value indicates negative infinity\.  
*Required*: Conditional  
*Type*: Double  
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`MetricIntervalUpperBound`  <a name="cfn-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-stepadjustment-metricintervalupperbound"></a>
The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric\. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive \(the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound\)\. Otherwise, it is inclusive \(the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound\)\. A null value indicates positive infinity\.  
The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound\.

`ScalingAdjustment`  <a name="cfn-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-stepadjustment-scalingadjustment"></a>
The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type\. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity\.  
The amount by which to scale\. The adjustment is based on the value that you specified in the `AdjustmentType` property \(either an absolute number or a percentage\)\. A positive value adds to the current capacity and a negative number subtracts from the current capacity\.   
*Required*: Yes  
*Type*: Integer
