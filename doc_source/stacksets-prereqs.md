# Prerequisites for Stack Set Operations<a name="stacksets-prereqs"></a>

Because stack sets perform stack operations across multiple accounts, before you can get started creating your first stack set you need to have the necessary permissions defined in your AWS accounts\.

To set up the required permissions for creating a stack set with **self\-managed** permissions, see [Grant Self\-Managed Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html)\.

To set up the required permissions for creating a stack set with **service\-managed** permissions, see [Enable Trusted Access with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-enable-trusted-access.html)\.
