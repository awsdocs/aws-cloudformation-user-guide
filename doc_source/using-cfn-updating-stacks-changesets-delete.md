# Deleting a change set<a name="using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-delete"></a>

Deleting a change set removes it from the list of change sets for the stack\. Deleting a change set prevents you or another user from accidentally executing a change set that shouldn't be applied\. Unless you delete them, CloudFormation retains all change sets until you update the stack\.

------
#### [ Delete a change set for nested stacks ]

**To delete a change set for nested stacks \(console\)**

1. In the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), in **Stacks**, select the stack name associated with the root change set\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change Sets** to view a list of the stack's change sets\.

1. Select the name of the change set that you want to delete\. 

1. On the change set's details page, choose **Delete**\. By choosing **Delete**, you will delete the whole hierarchy of nested change sets\.
**Note**  
The delete operation for change sets for nested stacks is asynchronous and will show a `DELETE_PENDING` status, followed by a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` status\. Upon completion of the delete change set operation, the change sets will be removed from the list\. Nested stacks in the `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` status will also be deleted if they were created during the change set creation\.

   CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of change sets\.
**Note**  
If you have nested stacks that are stuck in an in\-progress operation, see Troubleshooting Errors in [Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-nested-stacks-are-stuck)\.
