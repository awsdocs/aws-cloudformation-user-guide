# Estimating the cost of your AWS CloudFormation stack<a name="using-cfn-paying"></a>

There is no additional charge for AWS CloudFormation\. You pay for AWS resources \(for example, Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, and so on\) created using CloudFormation as if you created them by hand\.

**To estimate the cost of your stack**

1. On the **Review** page of the **Create stack** wizard, in the **Template** section, click the **Estimate cost** link\.  
![\[The Cost link on the Review page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-create-stack-review-template-cost.png)

   This link opens the **AWS Pricing Calculator** in a new browser tab\.
**Note**  
Because you launched the calculator from the CloudFormation console, it's pre\-populated with your template configuration and parameter values\. There are many additional configurable values that can provide you with a better estimate if you have an idea of how much data transfer you expect to your Amazon EC2 instance\. 

1. Choose the **Estimate of your Monthly Bill** tab for a monthly estimate of running your stack, along with a categorized display of what factors contributed to the estimate\.
