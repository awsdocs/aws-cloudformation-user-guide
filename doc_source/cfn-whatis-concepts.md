# AWS CloudFormation Concepts<a name="cfn-whatis-concepts"></a>

When you use AWS CloudFormation, you work with *templates* and *stacks*\. You create templates to describe your AWS resources and their properties\. Whenever you create a stack, AWS CloudFormation provisions the resources that are described in your template\.

## Templates<a name="w4784ab1b5c15b7"></a>

An AWS CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file\. You can save these files with any extension, such as `.json`, `.yaml`, `.template`, or `.txt`\. AWS CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources\. For example, in a template, you can describe an Amazon EC2 instance, such as the instance type, the AMI ID, block device mappings, and its Amazon EC2 key pair name\. Whenever you create a stack, you also specify a template that AWS CloudFormation uses to create whatever you described in the template\.

For example, if you created a stack with the following template, AWS CloudFormation provisions an instance with an `ami-0ff8a91507f77f867` AMI ID, `t2.micro` instance type, `testkey` key pair name, and an Amazon EBS volume\.

**Example JSON**  

```
{
  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
  "Description" : "A sample template",
  "Resources" : {
    "MyEC2Instance" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties" : {
        "ImageId" : "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867",
        "InstanceType" : "t2.micro",
        "KeyName" : "testkey",
        "BlockDeviceMappings" : [
          {
            "DeviceName" : "/dev/sdm",
            "Ebs" : {
              "VolumeType" : "io1",
              "Iops" : "200",
              "DeleteOnTermination" : "false",
              "VolumeSize" : "20"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example YAML**  

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: A sample template
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties: 
      ImageId: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: testkey
      BlockDeviceMappings:
        -
          DeviceName: /dev/sdm
          Ebs:
            VolumeType: io1
            Iops: 200
            DeleteOnTermination: false
            VolumeSize: 20
```

You can also specify multiple resources in a single template and configure these resources to work together\. For example, you can modify the previous template to include an Elastic IP \(EIP\) and associate it with the Amazon EC2 instance, as shown in the following example:

**Example JSON**  

```
{
  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
  "Description" : "A sample template",
  "Resources" : {
    "MyEC2Instance" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties" : {
        "ImageId" : "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867",
        "InstanceType" : "t2.micro",
        "KeyName" : "testkey",
        "BlockDeviceMappings" : [
          {
            "DeviceName" : "/dev/sdm",
            "Ebs" : {
              "VolumeType" : "io1",
              "Iops" : "200",
              "DeleteOnTermination" : "false",
              "VolumeSize" : "20"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "MyEIP" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::EIP",
      "Properties" : {
        "InstanceId" : {"Ref": "MyEC2Instance"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example YAML**  

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: A sample template
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties: 
      ImageId: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: testkey
      BlockDeviceMappings:
        -
          DeviceName: /dev/sdm
          Ebs:
            VolumeType: io1
            Iops: 200
            DeleteOnTermination: false
            VolumeSize: 20
  MyEIP:
    Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
    Properties:
      InstanceId: !Ref MyEC2Instance
```

The previous templates are centered around a single Amazon EC2 instance; however, AWS CloudFormation templates have additional capabilities that you can use to build complex sets of resources and reuse those templates in multiple contexts\. For example, you can add input parameters whose values are specified when you create an AWS CloudFormation stack\. In other words, you can specify a value like the instance type when you create a stack instead of when you create the template, making the template easier to reuse in different situations\.

For more information about template creation and capabilities, see [Template Anatomy](template-anatomy.md)\.

For more information about declaring specific resources, see [AWS Resource and Property Types Reference](aws-template-resource-type-ref.md)\.

## Stacks<a name="w4784ab1b5c15b9"></a>

When you use AWS CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack\. You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks\. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template\. Suppose you created a template that includes an Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) database instance\. To create those resources, you create a stack by submitting the template that you created, and AWS CloudFormation provisions all those resources for you\. You can work with stacks by using the AWS CloudFormation [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/), or [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation)\.

For more information about creating, updating, or deleting stacks, see [Working with Stacks](stacks.md)\.

## Change Sets<a name="w4784ab1b5c15c11"></a>

If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack\. Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of your proposed changes\. Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them\.

For example, if you change the name of an Amazon RDS database instance, AWS CloudFormation will create a new database and delete the old one\. You will lose the data in the old database unless you've already backed it up\. If you generate a change set, you will see that your change will cause your database to be replaced, and you will be able to plan accordingly before you update your stack\.
