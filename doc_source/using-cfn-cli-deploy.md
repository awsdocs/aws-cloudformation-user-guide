# Quickly deploying templates with transforms<a name="using-cfn-cli-deploy"></a>

AWS CloudFormation requires you to use a change set to create a template that includes transforms\. Instead of independently creating and then initiating a change set, use the `aws cloudformation deploy` command\. When you run this command, it creates a change set, initiates the change set, and then terminates\. This command reduces the numbers of required steps when you create or update a stack that includes transforms\.

The following command creates a new stack by using the `my-template.json` template\.

```
PROMPT> aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template /path_to_template/my-template.json \
  --stack-name my-new-stack \
  --parameter-overrides Key1=Value1 Key2=Value2 \
```

For more information, see the `aws cloudformation deploy` command in the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/index.html)
