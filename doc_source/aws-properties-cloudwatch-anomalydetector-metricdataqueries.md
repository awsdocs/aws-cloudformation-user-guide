# AWS::CloudWatch::AnomalyDetector MetricDataQueries<a name="aws-properties-cloudwatch-anomalydetector-metricdataqueries"></a>

An array of metric data query structures that enables you to create an anomaly detector based on the result of a metric math expression\. Each item in `MetricDataQueries` gets a metric or performs a math expression\. One item in `MetricDataQueries` is the expression that provides the time series that the anomaly detector uses as input\. Designate the expression by setting `ReturnData` to `true` for this object in the array\. For all other expressions and metrics, set `ReturnData` to `false`\. The designated expression must return a single time series\.
