# AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle<a name="aws-properties-waitconditionhandle"></a>

**Important**  
For Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling resources, we recommend that you use a `CreationPolicy` attribute instead of wait conditions\. Add a `CreationPolicy` attribute to those resources, and use the cfn\-signal helper script to signal when an instance creation process has completed successfully\.  
For more information, see [Deploying applications on Amazon EC2 with AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/deploying.applications.html)\.

The `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle` type has no properties\. When you reference the `WaitConditionHandle` resource by using the Ref function, AWS CloudFormation returns a presigned URL\. You pass this URL to applications or scripts that are running on your Amazon EC2 instances to send signals to that URL\. An associated `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition` resource checks the URL for the required number of success signals or for a failure signal\.

**Important**  
Anytime you add a `WaitCondition` resource during a stack update or update a resource with a wait condition, you must associate the wait condition with a new `WaitConditionHandle` resource\. Don't reuse an old wait condition handle that has already been defined in the template\. If you reuse a wait condition handle, the wait condition might evaluate old signals from a previous create or update stack command\.

**Note**  
Updates aren't supported for this resource\.
